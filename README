####### convert.php #######
Convert php files to static files.

The HTML is generated by calling the main php file:
./convert.php inputFolder outputFolder

This will generate html files in the folder outputFolder according to the content of the files in pages/
inputFolder/												outputFolder/
	samplePage.html.php										samplePage.html
	css/															css/
		style.css.php						->						style.css
	.parts/														
		samplePart.php											test.php
	.nophp/													
		test.php												

What the php script does is it includes the files that end with '.php' found in inputFolder/ and produces files with their output.
The pages in inputFolder/ are provided with the following classes:
Module( $tpl ) : $tpl filename/path of the tpl file
	$this->Arguments: Arguments passed to $tpl
	$this->Output: Outputs of $tpl after executing it. BE SURE IT HAS BEEN EXECUTED!

You can see sample pages in the inputFolder/ directory. The use is pretty straight forward. The pages that are
included by Module are sent a variable named "Arguments" which is an array containing the arguments
sent to this page. They can return an array named "Output" to the parent script/Module.

If you have files which should not be touched by the script, include them in a folder named .nophp folder.
Files in this folder will be copied directly to the output folder.
inputFolder/										outputFolder/	
	.nophp/							->					test.html.php
		test.html.php

All folders or files under inputFolder/ that are hidden (starting with a .), are not touched by the script. .nophp permits to copy these untouched files to the output folder. This is to prevent untrusted content from being seen as if it was a file to be executed.

NOTE 1: The script does what it can if there are errors. It will not clean after itself (check the output to see what fucked up).
NOTE 2: If a file included by Module( ) returns false, an exception will be thrown. This may abort the script if it is not catched/if it is thrown in a __toString( ).
NOTE 3: By default, the permissions on files ARE NOT preserved, even the ones on .nophp, the are recreated with an umask of 022
